# What Is Generative AI?

- **Creates new content** instead of just finding existing info  
- Examples: text, images, code, creative ideas  
- **Pattern-based prediction**, not thinking or consciousness  
- Uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** trained on vast data to predict what comes next  


**ðŸ’¡ Simple Analogy:**  
Like a super-powered autocomplete â€” itâ€™s read billions of examples, learned the patterns, and predicts the next word, pixel, or note until the work is complete.  
The results can look creative or logical, but itâ€™s really just *very good prediction*.

# Let's do everything live.....

<!-- This a general audience discussion on how some of AI tools work and what are we exactly talking to, will be using ChatGPT but
there are many others, and a lof of them have similer features.

Somthings work really well, however somethings don't, and somethings if we give it a bit better context can get more out of them 

type in "What are you?, "What are you?, How did you get created" -->

# What Is Generative AI?

- **Creates new content** instead of just finding existing info  
- Examples: text, images, code, creative ideas  
- **Pattern-based prediction**, not thinking or consciousness  
- Uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** trained on vast data to predict what comes next  


**💡 Simple Analogy:**  
Like a super-powered autocomplete — it’s read billions of examples, learned the patterns, and predicts the next word, pixel, or note until the work is complete.  
The results can look creative or logical, but it’s really just *very good prediction*.

# From Data to Intelligence: How AI Models Are Born

# How to Use Generative AI & LLMs (Live)

<!-- This a general audience discussion on how some of AI tools work and what are we exactly talking to, will be using ChatGPT but
there are many others, and a lof of them have similer features.

Somthings work really well, however somethings don't, and somethings if we give it a bit better context can get more out of them 

type in "What are you?, "What are you?, How did you get created" -->

---

# The easy part is the ask.. you simply ask it want you want.

Youd don't always get what you want, but sometimes you just might find you get what you need.

"Please help me write an email to ask my boss for a raise."

---

# How do we make it better

Basic prompting... persona, context, ask, example of showing exemplars

Becareful on how you ask it, if you direclty tell it to do something, it will try to accomplish that. 

---

My new favorite is using "Something Like" or "Like" 

---

# the other major area is context

---

Let's get back to the tooling and how it seems to understand and know us, this will help us give it the right context so it can pull the right information together to give us better responses.

---

What they are good at doing and what they are not good at doing... example if I have 100 documents and tell the model to give me information that would require all 100 documents it isn't going to give you what you want. 

It isn't always trueful.... you have to validate ... you are the one that is responsible for the work produced.

## Introduction
**Who is James Gress?**  
- Generative AI & Software Engineering Leader  
- Speaker, innovator, and AI practitioner  
- Today’s session: live exploration of AI, Generative AI, and LLMs

**Agenda**
- What AI, Generative AI, and LLMs are
- How they work
- How to get the most out of them
- Live demos
- Real-world applications

Note:
Open with energy. Let them know this is an interactive session. Mention your background and that you’ll be showing real tools in action.

---

## Setting the Stage

**From AI → Generative AI → LLM**
- **AI**: Broad category of systems that can mimic human intelligence.
- **Generative AI**: Creates new content (text, images, code, etc.).
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Specialized AI trained on vast text data.

Note:
Use OpenAI to generate short, engaging definitions for each term as a live example.

---

## Industry Perspective

> *"English is the new programming language."* – Jensen Huang  
> *"AI-driven automation will create new industries we can’t even imagine yet."* – Elon Musk  
> *"AI is the runtime… shaping applications and platforms."* – Satya Nadella

Note:
Set the tone with leaders’ visions. Highlight how transformational shifts always have enthusiasts, wait-and-seers, and contrarians.

---

## Under the Hood: How It Works

- How an LLM is created: training data, parameters, probability prediction
- Training cut-off date limits
- Getting current data into an LLM: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Why LLMs don’t truly “remember”
- Context windows: why you should start a new thread for a new topic

Note:
Explain memory vs. context. Show in OpenAI how context affects results.

---

## Prompting Basics

**The Prompt Equation**  
Task → Context → Examples → Persona

**Live Demo**:  
1. Email to leadership on benefits of ChatGPT at work  
2. Prompt to ask for a raise (include task, context, examples, persona)

Note:
Stress that more detail = better results. Show quick differences between vague and specific prompts.

---

## Tool Showcase

**We’ll explore**:  
- OpenAI (ChatGPT, DALL·E) → Ford Raptor image  
- Grok (x.com sentiment, posts)  
- Mistral  
- Perplexity  
- Claude (coding strength)  
- Microsoft Copilot  
- Gemini  
- LM Notebooks

Note:
Mention you’re using these because they’re familiar and safe for public demo, not necessarily “the best.”

---

## Leaderboards

**Model Leaderboards**  
- Overview of top LLM performance rankings
- Trends in speed, accuracy, and reasoning

Note:

- Generates new functionality quickly

**Challenges**:
- Still needs experienced engineers
- Skills gap in prompt-driven development
- Testing and DevOps integration gaps
- Security risks, rapid model changes

Note:
Tie back to your professional expertise. This is where “knowing AI” becomes a career advantage.

---

## Business & Career Implications

**For Individuals**:
- Tailor resumes, match job descriptions
- Interview coaching
- Learn prompt engineering

**For Organizations**:
- Productivity gains from AI training
- Governance via AI Centers of Excellence
- Manage data security risks

## Closing & Call to Action

**Key Takeaways**:
1. Start experimenting  
2. Learn prompt patterns  
3. Integrate AI into daily workflows  

**Final Quote**:
> *"English is the new programming language."*

Note:
End on inspiration. Invite Q&A and offer resources after the session.

- **Generative AI**: Creates new content (text, images, code, etc.).
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: AI trained on vast text datasets to understand and generate language.

**Live Demo:**  
Ask OpenAI: *"Explain AI, Generative AI, and LLM in one sentence each."*

Note:
Use the live demo to make definitions engaging.

---

## Industry Perspective

> *"AI is the runtime… shaping applications and platforms."* – Satya Nadella

Note:
Highlight how every big tech shift has enthusiasts, wait-and-seers, and contrarians.

---

## How Models Are Created

**LLM Training Basics**:
- Data collection
- Tokenization
- Neural network training
- Parameters & probability prediction
- Training cut-off dates

**Live Demo:**  
Ask ChatGPT: *"Explain how an LLM is trained"*, then have it create a simple diagram.

Note:
This builds understanding before we talk about using them effectively.

---

## Getting Started

**Steps:**
1. Pick a tool you’re comfortable with.
2. Start with a small, practical task.
3. Learn prompt patterns early.

Note:
This is the bridge from theory to hands-on.

---

## Prompting Basics

**The Prompt Equation**  
Task → Context → Examples → Persona

**Live Demos**:  
1. Vague vs. structured email prompt about ChatGPT benefits at work.  
2. Prompt to ask for a raise using task, context, examples, persona.

Note:
Show how more detail transforms results.

---

## Memory in AI

- LLMs don’t store personal info unless in app’s memory.
- Session context is temporary.
- Check memory: just ask the AI what it remembers.

**Live Demo:**  
Ask ChatGPT: *"What do you remember about me?"*

Note:
Explain reasons for clearing chat and starting new threads.

---

- **Gemini** – Google multimodal  
- **LM Notebooks** – Long-context special features

**New Additions**:
- **Google Search with AI** – Deep research  
- **Advanced Voice Mode** – Quick voice interaction  
- Saving notes while driving example  
- Quick action on phone to open AI voice

Note:
Mention you’re using these because they’re safe for public demo, not necessarily “the best.”
